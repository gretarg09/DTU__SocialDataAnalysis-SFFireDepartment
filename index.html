                        <h5> Intro </h5>

                        Fire departments play a vital role in most communities over the world. Fire fighter do not only prevent loss of life from fires, their task varies from rescuing victims from hazardous conditions to administering first aid during medial emergencies, in fact that is the biggest part of their jobs. In the article
                        <a href="http://work.chron.com/importance-firefighter-19431.html">The Importance of a Firefighter</a>
                        they found out that firefighters respond to almost 20 million medical emergencies, compared to approximately 1.4 million fires yearly on a national level in America. The response time of the fire department can make the difference between life and death, it is vital for all communities that the response time is minimized as much as possible. </br>

                        In this website we will take a look the response time of the Fire Department of San Francisco. The aim of the analysis is to explore the difference in response time in relation to both time and location in San Francisco. More specifically, we will try to create visualization that answers the following questions; is there a difference in response time between neighborhoods in San Francisco? is the response time dependent on the time of the day and is there a difference in response time between different types of calls e.g fire, alarm, life threatening, non life threatening? </br>

                        To accomplish this we explored the Fire Calls-For-Service data set from San Francisco. This article is devided into the following four sections; 

                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="index.html" class="introduction" style="color:rgba(208,85,75,1)"> INTRODUCTION </a> - Contains the idea of the project and information about the datasets</li>
                            <li><a href="responsetime.html" class="introduction" style="color:rgba(208,85,75,1)"> RESPONSE TIME </a>- Responsive histogram of neighborhood's response time</li>
                            <li><a href="geoplot.html" class="introduction" style="color:rgba(208,85,75,1)"> GEO PLOT </a>- Responsive geo plot where difference in response time between neighborhoods in San Francisco is visualized geographically.</li>
                            <li><a href="machinelearning.html" class="introduction" style="color:rgba(208,85,75,1)"> PREDICTION </a> -  Machine learning models created in order to predict the response time </li>
                        </ul> 

                        To get the most from this website we encourage the reader to go through the website in this order. In this website late responds time is defined as more than ten minutes and very late response time is defined as more than twenty minutes. These numbers are not chosen randomly, according to  this <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Delays-compound-S-F-s-ambulance-crisis-5769934.php#photo-6891963"> article </a> the city standard is that an ambulance should arrive at life-threatening emergencies within 10 minutes from when the call was received. The article also used 20 minutes as the standard for very late responses.

                        <p> A video made for this project can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO5uepJrnf0&feature=youtu.be">here</a>. We recommend drinking three cups of coffee before watching the video to avoid falling asleep.  </p>

                        If you, my dear reader, are interested in further exploring the analysing work done you are more than welcome to check out our exploratory notebook which contains more technical and in depth analysis of the dataset. The exploratory notebook can be found by clicking  <a href="explainer_notebook.ipynb"> here </a> <br/>.

                        <h5> Datasets </h5>

                            <p>The main data set behind the analysis in this website is the Fire Calls-For-Service dataset from the city of San Francisco. The dataset includes all fire units reponses to calls. Each record includes the call number, incident number, address, unit identifier, call type and disposition. All relevent time intervals are also included in the dataset. Because the dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involve multiple units, there are multiple record for each call number. In this article the reponse time is defined as the time that it takes the first responding unit to show up for service. The dataset can be downloaded from following link <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3/data"> SF Call For Service </a>. We focused on the period from 1st of January 2012 to 1st of January 2017.
                            </p>

                            <p> To get more perspective into our analysis we added information about each neighborhood in San Francisco. Unfortunately we did not find any open data sets that contained the wanted information and therefore we needed to create our own data set. The neighborhoodÂ´s information was found and extracted from this website <a href="http://www.city-data.com/nbmaps/neigh-San-Francisco-California.html "> SF neighborhood info </a>. The website contains alot of information about each neighborhood, therefore we needed to extract the most relevant information resulting in the following list.
                                <ul>
                                  <li style="padding:0; margin:0">Total population</li>
                                  <li style="padding:0; margin:0">Population density - People per square mile</li>
                                  <li style="padding:0; margin:0">Area - in square miles</li>
                                  <li style="padding:0; margin:0">Median household income</li>
                                  <li style="padding:0; margin:0">Ratio of people below poverty level</li>
                                  <li style="padding:0; margin:0">Ratio of people that speak english</li>
                                  <li style="padding:0; margin:0">Ratio of foreign born residents</li>
                                </ul>
                          
                            This info can be seen by hovering over each neighborhood in the responsive geo plot and the responsive histogram. This information is only suppose to be complimentary to the analysis of the Fire Calls-For-Service dataset. The City-data.com does not guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of any information on the site and therefore the data cannot be taken as the whole truth.

                            <p> The third data set, used in this article, contains the location and the battalion of each fire station. This data set is also self made and the information was extracted from the following website  
                                <a href="http://sf-fire.org/fire-station-locations"> Fire Station Locations. </a>
